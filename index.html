                    <p>Wind, solar, and storage hybrid energy plants are one of the largest in the country. Wheatridge Renewable Energy Facility is located in Oregon and combines a wind farm, solar array, and battery storage. The project will help comply with a 2021 Oregon State Law stating that major utilities must reduce emissions from generating electricity by 100 percent by 2040, creating clean electricity sources and new jobs. The state is experiencing wildfires, extreme heat, winter storms, and droughts due to climate change’s impact; the new plants will help counter those effects. Also developed by NextEra, the Skeleton Creek project in Oklahoma will also be going live next year. This plant will have 250 megawatts of wind, 250 megawatts of solar power, and a 200-megawatt battery storage system.</p>

        <iframe width="300" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ael-31dOULY" title="The world's first hydrogen-powered train has started running in Germany | Engadget Today" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="center" position="center"></iframe>
        <br>
            <p>Germany has started using the world's first hydrogen-powered train to replace diesel trains with eco-friendly technologies. The hydrogen trains have cells that produce electricity through a combination of hydrogen and oxygen, which leaves steam and water as emissions. The remaining energy is stored in ion lithium batteries. The train runs 62 miles between different towns and cities. It runs for about 600 miles with a single tank, similar to the amount diesel trains run. Using the hydrogen train will save 1.6 million liters of diesel fuel annually. The goal for Germany is to buy no longer diesel trains to combat climate change. Other European countries are following along with eco-friendly technology to combat climate change.    </p>
